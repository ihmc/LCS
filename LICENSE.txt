The "LCS Database" contains Lexical conceptual Structures built by
hand by Dorr in 1994, organized into semantic classes that are a
reformulated version of those in Beth Levin (1993) English Verb 
Classes and Alternations (EVCA), Part 2.  For a contrastive 
classification, see Levin's index at:
 http://www.umich.edu/~archive/linguistics/texts/indices/evca93.index
The LCS Database was hand-tagged with WordNet on a per-class basis,
using the 1.6 version of WordNet {Fellbaum, 1998).  The resulting
database was further extended to include 26 new classes (Dorr, 1996,
1997), and adding 3000 WordNet-tagged verbs.  Additional contributions
to this database were made in collaboration with Douglas Jones (Dorr
and Jones, 1999) and the classes were further refined by Mari Olsen
(Olsen et al. 1997) so that they contain semantic representation that
indicate verbal telicity patterns.  Levin's original database
contained 3024 verbs in 192 classes numbering between 9.1 and 57---a
total of 4186 verb entries. The augmented database contains 4432 verbs
in 492 classes with more specific numbering (e.g., ``51.3.2.a.ii'')
and additional class numbers for new classes (between 000 and 026)---a
total of 11000 verb entries.  The verbs in the "LCS Database" is
alternately referred to as EVCA+ in some recent publications (Green et
al, 2001a, 2001b).

The latest version of the LCS Database contains a set of argument 
frames that conform to the style of those adopted in the PropBank
effort at the University of Pennsylvania (Palmer et al., 2001).

The LCS Database has been used extensively in the dissertation work 
of Scott Thomas and Nizar Habash.  Relevant citations are given below.

We would like to thank Julie Dahmer, Charles Lin, and David
Woodard for their WordNet annotations which we used here.  We
would also like to thank Karen Kohl for her annotations of the
verbs in Part 1 of Levin's work, which we used to give hints for
annotating these verbs of Part 2.
